## Founder University 60-Second Video (Bullet Talk Track)

- I'm Andriy, building Artly Labs: the parent operating system for kids ages 0-6 years old.
- Our first app, Sonito, helps parents improve their babies' sleep. It combines sleep tracking, nap forecasts, and guidance to help parents make better daily decisions.
- I'm a parent and felt this pain directly. Existing baby apps are outdated and not useful enough in real life.
- We already have 170 paying customers and over $2k MRR, and 80x 5-star reviews on the App Store.
- A bit about me: I have 10 years of engineering product experience, and I'm currently a founding engineer at a startup acquired by Coinbase. I'm transitioning to build this business full-time.
- I'm focused on scaling Sonito in baby sleep niche, then expanding into feeding and development for parents. This is a big market opportunity right now with lots of outdated products.
- Thank you for your time. I hope to hear from you soon.

## Core Positioning (Use Everywhere)

Artly Labs is building the parent operating system for ages 0-6, starting with sleep. Our first product, Sonito, helps parents improve baby sleep outcomes with a faster, simpler, and more personalized experience than legacy tracking apps.

## Founder University Draft Answers

### What are you building?

We are building Artly Labs, a modern product company for families with kids ages 0-6. We started with Sonito, a baby sleep product that focuses on outcomes, not just logs. Parents use Sonito to make better daily sleep decisions with less friction and more confidence.

### Why this problem?

I am a new parent, and I felt this pain directly. The tools I found were hard to use, looked outdated, and did not adapt well to real family schedules. I decided to build what I wished existed: fast, simple, modern, and personalized products for early parenthood.

### Why now?

Most category incumbents were built years ago and have not meaningfully evolved. Today, we can combine better UX, faster shipping, and modern personalization to deliver much better day-to-day outcomes for parents.

### What traction do you have?

Sonito has 175+ paying customers and over $2k MRR. This validates that parents will pay for a better experience in a high-frequency workflow.

### What is the bigger vision?

Sleep is the wedge. Next we expand into feeding/solids, then development. Over time, Artly Labs becomes a connected stack of daily decision tools for parents in the 0-6 stage.

### Why Founder University?

Founder University is a strong fit for us at this stage because we have early paying traction and a clear path from focused wedge to platform. We want coaching, founder community, and investor network to accelerate product velocity and go-to-market execution.

## YC Draft Answers

### What does your company do in one sentence?

Artly Labs builds modern, personalized products for parents with children ages 0-6, starting with baby sleep through Sonito.

### What are you building?

Our first product, Sonito, helps parents improve baby sleep outcomes. We are not building a passive tracker; we are building an outcome-oriented decision tool that is easier and faster to use than legacy options.

### Why are you the right founder?

I am the target user. As a new parent, I personally experienced how weak current products are and built Sonito to solve that pain properly. I am applying as a solo founder, and my partner is an active source of day-to-day product feedback from real usage. That proximity gives us speed, product intuition, and clear prioritization.

### How far along are you?

We have 175+ paying customers and over $2k MRR.

### How big can this get?

Sleep is only the first daily workflow. We are building a broader 0-6 parent operating system, with planned expansion to feeding/solids and development.

### What have you learned so far?

Parents do not want more logs. They pay for products that reduce stress and improve day-to-day outcomes. Better UX and personalization are major unlocks in this category.

### What will you do in the next 6-12 months?

1. Deepen sleep outcomes and retention in Sonito.
2. Launch feeding/solids as the second workflow.
3. Build shared identity, data, and recommendation infrastructure to support development expansion.

## Optional Add-On Answer (if asked about M&A strategy)

We are open to selective acquisitions if they accelerate product quality and distribution, but the primary near-term plan is focused organic execution: dominate sleep outcomes first, then expand step-by-step into adjacent workflows.

## Inputs Still Needed to Finalize

- Current monthly growth rate (MoM)
- Trial-to-paid conversion
- 8-week retention
- Any key user outcome stats (for example: average reduction in nighttime wakeups)
