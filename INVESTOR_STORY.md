# Artly Labs Investor Story (Draft v1)

## Application Timing Check (as of February 13, 2026)
- Founder University currently describes itself as a 10-week pre-accelerator and lists Cohort 12 for March 2026.
- Founder University FAQ says: "You can apply to Founder University at any time." (rolling admissions language).
- Y Combinator currently says Spring 2026 on-time deadline was February 9, 2026 at 8:00 PM PT, and late applications are still being accepted.
- Action: submit FU promptly for Cohort 12 consideration, and submit YC as late Spring 2026 with strongest current metrics and product updates.

## One-Line Pitch
Artly Labs is building the parent operating system for ages 0-6, starting with sleep: we help parents make better daily decisions with personalized, outcome-driven tools, and then expand into adjacent high-frequency workflows where existing products are outdated.

## Current Wedge (What Exists Today)
- Product: Sonito (`https://sonito.app/`) - baby sleep tracking and optimization.
- Traction: nearly 200 paying customers and about $2k MRR.
- Core insight: parents do not just want logs; they want fewer wakeups, better sleep outcomes, and confidence in daily decisions.

## Founder-Market Fit Story (Website + Applications)
- Solo founder is a new parent who experienced the pain firsthand and used existing tools daily.
- Founder is applying solo, with partner support as a constant real-world feedback loop.
- Existing parent apps in this category often feel 5-8 years behind on UX, speed, and personalization.
- Artly Labs exists because current technology allows dramatically better product quality, iteration speed, and parent-specific customization.

## Why This Can Be Venture-Scale
- Massive, recurring market: each new birth cohort replenishes demand.
- High-intent user segment: parents actively pay for tools that reduce stress and improve child outcomes.
- Multi-product expansion path: sleep is the first daily behavior loop; adjacent loops include feeding/solids, development, and family coordination.
- Roll-up opportunity: several legacy products in this market have weak UX, weak personalization, and slow product velocity.

## Company Narrative for Angels / FU / YC
### Positioning
- Not "just a tracker."
- Start with one painful job-to-be-done (sleep), dominate outcomes, then expand to a portfolio of connected parent workflows for ages 0-6.

### Category Statement
Artly Labs is building the trusted daily decision layer for early parenthood.

### Why Now
- AI-enabled personalization can convert passive logs into prescriptive guidance.
- Parents increasingly adopt paid mobile products for childcare workflows.
- Many category incumbents are content-heavy or static, not adaptive products.

## Product Strategy (0 -> 1 -> N)
### Phase 1: Sleep Dominance (now)
- Deliver measurable outcomes: faster bedtime, fewer nightly wakeups, better nap consistency.
- Improve onboarding speed-to-value (first "aha" in <24 hours).
- Build retention loops: daily check-ins, weekly progress summaries, personalized plans.

### Phase 2: Adjacent Workflow Expansion (next)
- Add one tightly related module: feeding/solids planning and tracking.
- Reuse parent profile, child profile, and behavior timeline as shared infrastructure.
- Cross-sell into existing Sonito base before broader acquisition spend.

### Phase 3: Multi-Product Platform (later)
- Expand into development and other adjacent 0-6 workflows after feeding/solids proves pull.
- Launch/acquire and modernize high-demand tools in 0-6 market.
- Unify accounts, billing, identity, and recommendations across products.
- Become the default subscription for early-parent decision support.

## Moat Design
- Proprietary behavioral dataset across sleep + feeding.
- Outcome-focused recommendation engine tuned on real family usage patterns.
- Distribution moat from trust, referrals, and multi-product bundling.
- Execution moat: rapid iteration in under-served categories with outdated incumbents.

## GTM Plan
- Primary channels: App Store SEO, short-form parent education content, communities, referral loops.
- Conversion strategy: free utility -> paid plan when personalized recommendations unlock.
- Retention strategy: weekly improvement reports + milestone-based nudges.
- Expansion strategy: bundle pricing once second workflow module is live.

## Metrics That Matter to Early Investors
Track and report these weekly:
- New trials / week
- Trial-to-paid conversion
- 4-week retention
- 8-week retention
- Net revenue retention (if annual plans exist)
- CAC payback period
- Wakeup/bedtime outcome improvements (product efficacy metric)

## 12-Week Execution Plan (FU-friendly)
### Weeks 1-4
- Tighten positioning and website narrative around "0-6 parent operating system, starting with sleep."
- Instrument full funnel and retention analytics.
- Ship one high-impact onboarding and activation improvement.

### Weeks 5-8
- Launch one adjacent beta feature to validate expansion thesis.
- Run structured interviews with active payers and churned users.
- Publish first version of outcome dashboard (for internal and investor updates).

### Weeks 9-12
- Show compounding traction in conversion + retention.
- Finalize repeatable acquisition channel with payback assumptions.
- Prepare FU/YC application package: concise story, metric snapshots, and roadmap.

## FU / YC Style Application Framing
Use this pattern consistently:
1. Problem: parents are overwhelmed and current tools are fragmented or outdated.
2. Solution: Sonito delivers measurable sleep outcomes with personalized guidance.
3. Traction: nearly 200 paying users with early evidence of demand.
4. Insight: sleep is the entry wedge into a larger 0-6 workflow platform.
5. Plan: disciplined expansion into adjacent high-frequency parent jobs.
6. Ask: coaching + network + capital to accelerate compounding product velocity.

## Risks and How to De-Risk
- Risk: story sounds too broad too early.
  - Mitigation: keep near-term roadmap narrow and metric-driven.
- Risk: weak retention despite initial paid conversion.
  - Mitigation: prioritize measurable outcomes and recurring engagement loops.
- Risk: expansion before wedge is strong.
  - Mitigation: gate new modules on sleep retention and conversion targets.

## What You Need Before Submitting Applications
- A clean KPI snapshot (last 8-12 weeks).
- A crisp founder story: why you uniquely understand parent pain and can out-execute incumbents.
- A simple but credible 12-month roadmap with one core product plus one expansion bet.

## Clarifying Questions (Answer These Next)
1. What are your current growth rate, trial-to-paid conversion, and 8-week retention?
2. Are you open to acquisition/roll-up strategy in year 1, or only organic product expansion?

## Suggested Core Message (Website + Applications)
"Artly Labs is building the parent operating system for ages 0-6. We start with sleep, where Sonito already helps families improve outcomes, and expand into the next high-impact parent workflows with modern, personalized products."
